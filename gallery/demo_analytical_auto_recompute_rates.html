<p>This example shows how to use the the auto recomputing functionality for growth rates
in the analytical classes. To follow this example please first have a look at the
<a class="reference internal" href="demo_analytical_nagaitsev_emittances.html#demo-analytical-nagaitsev"><span class="std std-ref">Analytical Nagaitsev example</span></a> as well as the relevant
<a class="reference internal" href="../faq/auto_recomputing.html#xibs-faq-auto-recompute-growth-rates"><span class="std std-ref">FAQ section</span></a>.</p>
<p>This script will showcase the functionality by following an identical flow to the
Nagaitsev example linked above and expanding on the relevant parts. Demonstration will
be done using the SPS top protons line.</p>

IBS is an exponential that depends on the value at the previous step, and the
growth rate for the given plane. As long as the growth rate is not re-computed,
then the relative change from one time step to the next will be the same. We can
have a look at the relative change from the last time growth rates were updated:</p>

scenario keeps increasing between re-computes of the growth rates. Because we
pushed the beam parameters to the extreme, the emittances grow “too fast” from
the start to the first recompute of the rates 10 minutes in.</p>
<p>The “auto-only” recomputing scenario initially updates its growth rates very
frequently in the beginning of the simulation: almost every time step for the
first 10 minutes of simulated beam time. As the horizontal emittance and the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta_p\)</span> and bunch length grow, the effect of IBS decreases and the
rates are not updated as frequently.</p>

<h2>Takeaways<a class="headerlink" href="#takeaways" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>One can see the difference made by the auto-recomputing, especially in the horizontal
plane where a large gap to the “fixed interval” scenario is observed for the final
values reached, despite an asymptotic behaviour. In the beginning of the simulation,
auto-recomputing is very frequent and avoid an unrealistic growth of the emittances.</p>
<p>It is important for the user to choose an appropriate threshold value. A value too
high will lead to the rates not updating frequently enough and potentially unrealistic
evolutions, while a value too low will lead to the rates re-computing at every step for
a long time, which is computationally expensive and unnecessary.</p>
